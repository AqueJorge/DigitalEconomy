### The growth of the digital economy
Due to everything happening because of COVID-19, we extended our digital technologies dependency to basically every aspect of our lives, school, work, entertainment, social gatherings, groceries, etc. they all depend on people from around the world to interact with each other. We can see that from our own difficulties getting acquainted with software such as Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and other school platforms, as well as the way the whole internship process works. Now there are more possibilities given the fact that companies around the world now adapted to work remotely, as well as the fact that we now generate way more information than we did before. Every phone call, video call, text message, email, purchase now done online instead of on site. That generates more information, which needs more storage space, which requires more people to design, process, store, as well as oversee the online security. We can add the people who manage these teams and the new departments created, all of this just from a “small” tweak in the way we interact. That’s how quickly we made the new economy grow in a span of less than two years.

### ICT-based business models
We could compare the work of an architect and the work of a manager, given the right conditions. An architect planning a building needs to father information about many things (environment, stakeholders, legal boundaries, etc.) as well as analyzing and discussing different ideas with their teams and investors. Once they have an idea, they can start sketching their way through meetings until it finally ends up on a set of plans. A manager works in the same way, creating a strategy and setting up a business model that can be considered viable, as well as overseeing the implementation in all aspects of it (processes, structure, and ICT). 

You can also understand it as physical vs social planners in a way. While architects use sophisticated software tools to plan the buildings, managers on the other hand use word processors and maybe some graphical tools to plan and implement logic into their business. A modern manager on an ICT-based business model will focus on each point of the ICT indicators to plan the strategy, then on e-business opportunities for the business model and will end up with the company adapting to e-business processes. After all, the majority of recent publications of international organizations stress the fact that the encouragement and support of e-entrepreneurship is indispensable if developing countries don’t want to miss out on the possibilities of ICT.

### Strategic Data Analysis
Data acquisition and analysis are critical elements in strategic measurement and control system effectiveness. A representative strategic data analysis process is illustrated in Figure 1., it contends that ‘strategic controllers’ should undertake such a process in order to better understand the underlying drivers of strategic results.

Different authors have long argued that data analysis allows individuals and organizations to better understand and identify factors that could trigger that need for a change in the strategy. These factors also become reliable because they can be verified, tracked to their root data and source. 

### Describe ICT patents

THe ICT patents baiscally tries to make a whole protection of the different systems that are related to the ICT sector, this has become very useful, since 2004 the number of patents have increase dratically, in ten years the number of ITC patterns have increase at least 30%, which make it be a good indicator of how usefull they can be. There have been many different countries that have beeen working in the development of ITC projects, this because it has become a way to increase the income, so from this there are some specific countires that have been targeting this project and becoming a big part of the population that extends patterns.The countries that are most revelvant in this section are: USA, Japan and  China. The most relevant areas where this patents are available, and protected are the following: high-speed network, mobile communication, digital security, sensor and device networks, high-speed computing, large capacity and high-speed storage, large capacity information analysis, cognition and meaning understanding, human interface, imaging and sound technologies.

### Impact in telecommunications, health, agriculture, science & energy.

The impact of the Digital Economy has been a lot thanks to the pandemic,with the quarentine, people was not able to do a lot of things that they were used to do, and with this new ways of offering technologie arrived, this is why the impact has been enormous. As long as the impact has been in all the different industries, it is needed to shape it and describe it each on of them, and realizing how did it impact, and it is about to impact.

in terms of the communication, it represented a big problem because it was needed not just to update systems  and ask people for "acess", and this was one of the main challenges and each country encourage this defisit on this indicator as they could do it, each situation was different, but the challenge started there, and end up in the needed avances in the communication industry to have the infrestructure to accep all this changes and new ways of approaching things. Lastly, the 5G is also one of the advances tht have impact directly to this sector. 

In health industrie it has been one of the ones that most been be impacted, this because there have been approaches that were not explode before, just like the implementaion of AI that uses the data of millions of comments in order to know how the population reacted to new health measurements. But it didn't help just there, becuase with the implementation of the new technologies, the vaccination process has being easier because of the facilities that this policies represent. 

When we want to talk about the impact in agricutlure everything becomes blurred, because it is not an industy that is very commertial, and that many people is aware of, neverthless the technology has attack this angle strongly, to equip all the different farms, in each of the parts of the process with sensors, provide very importnt information to the agricutures, and become very helpful in every stage of the process. 

In terms of science and enery, has also been an important factor, in this case, the patents in the different approaches that this areas could have are being used by the world powers, and is becoming an indicator in the development of a counry. Besides that, the collaboration of the countries thanks to those policies become mucho more efficient, what is a great advantage to make science achivements witht he help of the accessibility of the information.     


### Identify the historical stages of the development of technology.

In the following image, we can take a look at the amount of time it took for a new technology to reach a state of mass adoption. Every technology was invented to solve a problem. For example, search engines were created to segregate massive amounts of online data and pick out the most relevant ones. With every new upgrade, technology keeps improving. Platforms get better and expand what they can accomplish. The more often this happens, technology evolves to become the vital necessity it is today.


As new ideas get transformed into new forms of technologies, these new technologies are all set to become future mechanisms of future technologies. Existing technologies progress into something way more powerful and superior to what we had previously.

The proliferation of innovation pertains to two important factors of technology driving innovation: the creation of geographic hubs for technology and empowerment of knowledge exchange through communication and transportation. Places like California’s Silicon Valley and Baden-Wurttenberg in Germany are strong examples of the value of technological hubs. The close proximity of various resources and collaborators in each hub stimulates a higher degree of innovative capacity.
Communication and cumulative knowledge in these technology hubs allows for these innovations to spread via technology to be implemented across the globe with relative immediacy. This spread of ideas can be built upon quickly and universally, creating the ability for innovation to be further expanded upon by different parties across the globe. Collaboration on a global scale as a result of technological progress has allowed for exponential levels of innovation.


### Identify the relevant indicators of the digital economy.

There are many indicators that we can study an take advantage of accoding to different situations, in the case of digital economu, the indicators are stated by the framework from where we are working, when taking the OECD as the main framework to use there are 7 different indicators that we could take as the most importants. To make this different indicators clear, we are going to describe them. 
- Access.- This indicatore refere basically to the availability of the different regions all across the world, what is trying to measure the access indicator is the quality of the infrestructures where the people can have access to the internet, and with that be part of the connectivity of th Digital enviroment
- Use.- The useage that a technology could actually impact to the society, and how the gouverments try to make the implementations of technological solutions into their strategies for being more effective
- Innovation.- This point is essential, because the innovation is a key point to push the actual limits. It has a lot of repecution because the investments in digital technologies increases, and let different project be possible thanks to the innversion and the innovation.
- Jobs.- It foucses in the way we work now a days, and that we most be sure that the digital transformation is not going to make worst the human life.  
- Society.- To make sure that the technologi is being implementated like, becuase of the waterfall spread, besides that the people who is ineterested in adopting a new culture could do it without being hard and with the least requirements as posible
- Trust.- It is the trust that the technologies generate on people, basically, becuase in case that the tehcnologies that we know to keep using it is not a problem, but when you are trying another one it feels different and you feel more secure in the one we know, and that is why it is a challenge and and indicator
- Market openess.- To have an open makert where everyone is capable of trade and invest, is part of the mission of this main. Besides that, the ecommece has been also one of the ones that have become mas relevant because of the pandemic.  

### Identify the impact of ICTs in other areas.

As Home and Domestic Activities: We can connect and controls domestic equipments (such as washing machine, refrigerator,  cell-phones, laptops  etc.). Carry out  net banking,  online shopping,  read  newspapers  online,  watch  TV  programs,  impart  education  and  connects ourselves to our family, friends, or relatives while we are at long distance by using the e-mail, messenger, call-conference, or video-conference.  
As  Social  Networking:  There are many social networking sites are available like FACEBOOK, ORKUT, TWITTER, and LINKEDIN which allows users to communicate and stay connected with each other across the globe regularly.
As Education/E-Learning: E-Learning is an electronic learning, in which the learner uses a computer to learn a task, skill, or process at that time teacher teaches through the computer online. Students can learn by watching videos, e-books, discussion groups, bulletin boards, blogs and e-learning in a collaborate environment. Students can also ask question to their teacher using emails.

As Health: When we get sick, we don't like to go outside even to visit the doctors. It is helpful to medical students to learn about disease, medicines, and surgeries through video-conferencing.
As  Shopping/Commerce:  It makes buying and selling activities easier, more efficient and faster by using computers, internet and shared software.
As Banking: Banking helped  us to buy things using E-commerce.  It carries out electronic transactions through Debit/Credit cards, net banking and Air/Rail tickets booking at anyplace at anytime with the use our same banking account. We can save our time, access accounts for loan applications, transactions and update our cash flow at any time. Banking is facilitated with virtual money so it introduces an Eco-friendly world.  
As Employment/Jobs: ICT increases the number of employments in our society. People can work as Web developer, IT network administrator, etc who have skills in ICT.  It gives new job opportunities for many people to become successful  self-employer to work from their home.
